        Please edit or overlay this file for ROM integration.
        This allows Repainter to work better with your ROM.

        To overlay this, make a copy of this file (including config_metadata_version) and add it to your overlay package.
        For example, the full path (from the root of your ROM tree) could be:
            vendor/proton/overlay/packages/apps/RepainterServicePriv/res/values/config.xml
    -->

    <!-- [DO NOT CHANGE] Config version, used by Repainter to determine how to interpret this config. -->
    <integer name="config_metadata_version">1</integer>

    <!-- [Required] Unique vendor name to identify this ROM. Examples: protonaosp, posp, lineageos -->

        [Optional] Colors to use for theming the system boot animation with dynamic colors.
        Please note that this alone will not give you a dynamically-colored boot animation; it
        requires a boot animation that already supports dynamic colors.

        By default, Android only supports 4 colors, but Repainter will accomodate more colors with
        the same naming scheme (persist.bootanim.color#) if you've modded cmds/bootanimation to
        support more colors.

        All standard Material You swatches and shades are supported:
            accent1, accent2, accent3, neutral1, neutral2
            0, 10, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000
        Repainter also supports some additional non-standard shades:
            20, 650, 950
        If you need a custom shade that isn't already available, feel free to request it by reaching
        out or opening an issue. You can safely add the shade to this config regardless, as Repainter
        will automatically use the nearest supported shade until your exact shade is added.
